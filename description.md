🚀 Built an AI Chatbot using the Groq API! 🤖

I’m excited to share my latest project: Groq API Chatbot, a simple yet extensible AI chatbot that demonstrates how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) using an API-driven architecture.

💡 What this project does:

Integrates Groq LLM API for ultra-fast inference

Clean and modular Python-based backend

Streamlit UI for interactive chat experience

Secure API key handling using environment variables

Easy to extend with memory, tools, or RAG

🎥 Demo Video Included
I’ve attached a short demo video in this post that walks through the chatbot UI and shows how responses are generated in real time.
